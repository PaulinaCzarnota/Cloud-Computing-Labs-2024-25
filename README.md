This repository contains a collection of labs completed for the Cloud Computing module during my third year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

## Lab Summaries

**Lab 1**

This lab focuses on using Google Cloud Shell to explore essential Linux command-line skills. It covers file creation and management, modifying file permissions, manipulating text files, and managing system processes. Key commands include chmod, grep, sort, and ps, providing a foundation for efficient cloud-based system administration.

**Lab 2**

In this lab, I explored the practical aspects of virtualization using Oracle VM VirtualBox, focusing on creating and managing a virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu Linux. The activities I undertook included:

1. **Creating a New Virtual Machine**: I set up a VM configured to run Ubuntu Linux, specifying system resources based on my host machine's capabilities.

2. **Boot Configuration**: I configured the VM to boot from a virtual Linux CD by attaching the Ubuntu ISO file to the virtual CD-ROM.

3. **Shared Folder Setup**: I established a shared folder between my host and the guest VM to facilitate file transfer.

4. **Ubuntu Installation**: I installed the Ubuntu operating system in the VM, configuring user accounts and system settings as part of the process.

5. **Guest Additions Installation**: I installed Oracle VM Guest Additions to enhance the performance and integration of the VM with the host system.

6. **Exporting the VM**: I exported the configured VM as an OVA file for portability and ease of use on different systems.

7. **Importing a VM**: I practiced importing an existing OVA file into VirtualBox, showcasing the simplicity of managing virtual appliances.

8. **Direct Backup**: I conducted a direct backup of the VM to an external drive, ensuring quick access and storage.

9. **Adding Existing VM**: I demonstrated the process of adding an existing VM from an external storage device, emphasizing quick VM deployment.
