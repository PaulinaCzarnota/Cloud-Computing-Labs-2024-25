### Cloud Computing - Lab 1 Solutions 

### Introduction

This lab focuses on understanding and using the Linux command-line terminal. The exercises are performed in the Google Cloud Shell, where you can execute commands directly in a cloud-based environment.

### How to Access the Google Cloud Shell

To access the Google Cloud Shell, ensure you have a Gmail account and log in at [Google Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com). Your shell session will persist as long as itâ€™s active.

### Setup and First-Time Configuration

- **Remove the default project ID from the shell prompt**:

    ```bash
    gcloud config unset project
    ```

- **Restore man pages**:
  
    If the `man` command is not working, you can run the following script to restore manual pages in the shell:

    ```bash
    sudo sed -i '/path-exclude/s/^/#/' /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes
    sudo apt-get --reinstall install man-db manpages manpages-dev vim -y
    sudo apt-get install manpages-posix manpages-posix-dev -y
    sudo mv /usr/bin/man.REAL /usr/bin/man
    sudo mandb -c
    ```
